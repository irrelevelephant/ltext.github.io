        <h2 class="ui header">Step 1: Have a Text File</h2>
        <p>The first thing you need is a text file you want to parameterize. This
           can be Html, JavaScript, Haskell, Bash, TeX, <em>anything</em>. In this
           example, we'll use a plantext file <code>foo</code>:
        </p>
        <pre>
Woo hoo! I'm a Text File!

Here's some content that I /really/
don't want inside here. Oh well!
        </pre>

        <h2 class="ui header">Step 2: Create a Parameter</h2>
        <p>Just like lambda calculus, we create arity via <em>abstraction</em> -
           the act of creating a parameter. In λtext it's very easy - all we need
           to do is, on the first line, declare our parameters inside <strong>delimiters</strong>.
           Then, we use those declared variables by referencing their names with
           <strong>the same delimiters</strong>. We are free to choose the syntax we
           wish - Jade-style delimiters with <code>{{ }}</code>, Html-friendly
           delimiters via comments <code>&lt;!-- --></code>, etc. Here's our
           new and improved <code>foo</code>:
        </p>
        <pre>
$$ x %%
Woo hoo! I'm a Text File!

$$ x %%
        </pre>
      </div>

        <h2 class="ui header">Step 3: Have Another File to Substitute</h2>
        <p>Now that we have our function/file <code>foo</code>, we need some content
           to use as it's input. Easy enough, we can just plug in the content we
           ripped-out into the file <code>bar</code>:
        </p>
        <pre>
Here's some content that I /really/
don't want inside here. Oh well!
        </pre>
      </div>
      <div class="eight wide column">
        <h2 class="ui header">Step 4: Apply the Files/Functions with λtext</h2>
        <p>Lastly, to use our functions, we must <em>apply</em> one to another -
           the other counterpart to lambda calculus. To do this, invoke the
           <code>ltext</code> command from a terminal:
        </p>
        <pre>
$ ltext "foo bar"

Woo hoo! I'm a Text File!

Here's some content that I /really/
don't want inside here. Oh well!
        </pre>
        <p>Normally, the result of the expression we supply to <code>ltext</code>
           (ie: the files we wish to apply) just pumps out <code>stdout</code>.
           But, if that's unwanted, there's a flag for that!
