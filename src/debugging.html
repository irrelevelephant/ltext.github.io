      If you toyed around with the <code>apply</code> function from earlier, you
      may have seen a daughnting error:
    </p>
    <pre>
$ <span style="color: #00AD9C;">ltext</span> <span style="color: #E07B53;">"\f -> apply f bar"</span>

ltext: Error: Result has literals in sub expression - `λf. (#apply) <> (f #bar)` - cannot render soundly.</pre>
    <p>
      This is intended! This makes sure that the templates we render are actually
      <em>renderable</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In laymen's terms, a template can only be rendered if <strong>all</strong>
      <code>Text</code> data that is concatenated (<code>&lt;&gt;</code>) is at the
      "top level" - if after reducing our expression, we wind up applying text to
      an unknown function, or applying unknown input to a file, we can't fully
      substitute the text, and are left with dangling references to files.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can check the type of these expressions, but we can't render them. To
      help us see what is going on under-the-hood, it's sometimes helpful to
      "show" the underlying expression:
    </p>
    <pre>
$ <span style="color: #00AD9C;">ltext</span> <span style="color: #E07B53;">"\f -> apply f bar"</span> --show

λf. (#apply) <> (f #bar) :: (Text -> Text) -> Text</pre>
    <p>
      By looking at this type, you can see that we still need a
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style" target="_blank">continuation-passing-style</a>
      function <code>f</code> before we can get our result. Looking at the expression
      itself, you can see that we're applying the <code>bar</code> file to the
      unknown function <code>f</code> - therefore we can't substitute it in our result.
      <blockquote>
        We prepend file names with <code>#</code> in an attempt to distinguish them
        from normal terms.
      </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
      So, if you ever get this error, you know that there's something you still need
      to apply before you can fully render your expression. I hope that clears up
      some headaches!
