        <p>
          There are a few other things to consider when working with λtext -
          type checking, partial application, and debugging.

        <h2 class="ui header">Type Checking</h2>
        <p>
          To inspect the type of a file or an expression, simply include the
          <code>-t</code> option during invocation:
        </p>
        <pre>
$ ltext "foo" -t

foo :: Text -> Text
        </pre>
        <p>
          You can read this as "foo takes in Text and returns Text", or "foo is a
          <em>function</em> from Text to Text". This is useful if you are getting
          type matching errors, or want to get a <em>description</em> of a file. We
          can also check the type signature of expressions directly:
        </p>
        <pre>
$ ltext "\x -> x" -t

λx. x :: ∀ a0. a0 -> a0
        </pre>
        <p>
          This is a little technical, but we are creating a <strong>polymorphic</strong>
          function <code>\x -> x</code>, which has a type from <strong>for all a0</strong>
          to <code>a0</code> (you may see these cryptic type variables instead of <code>Text</code>
          from time to time). This would happen if, for instance, you made an "apply"-like
          template:
        </p>
        <pre>
%% f x %%

asdf

%% f x %%
        </pre>
        <p>
          If you check the type of <code>apply</code>, you can see it's...
        </p>
        <pre>
$ ltext -t "apply"

apply :: ∀a0. (a0 -> Text) -> a0 -> Text
        </pre>
        <p>
          Meaning that <code>x</code> can be content of <em>any</em> type, so long
          as it's the same input as <code>f</code>.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="column">
        <h2 class="ui header">Partial Application</h2>
        <p>
          Just like lambda calculus, we can partially apply templates to each other.
          Take our <code>apply</code> template from before - that's a good example
          to work though. If we apply our <code>foo</code> file from before to
          <code>apply</code>, we should get a template from <code>Text -> Text</code> -
          the paramter to <code>foo</code> being unified with the <code>x</code> parameter
          in <code>apply</code>:
        </p>
        <pre>
$ ltext -t "apply foo"

apply foo :: Text -> Text
        </pre>
        <p>
          It turns out, we can actually render this partially applied template.
